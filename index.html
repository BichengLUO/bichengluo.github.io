      <p>Parocam (有劲) is an iOS app which utilize <a href="https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage" target="_blank">GPUImage</a> and <a href="">Sensetime</a> face detection and alignment technology. The name of the app comes from <em>Parody Camera</em>. It allows realtime recording with various creation modes, such as face features morphing, background changing and smart masks. With the help of the app, users can create a great many impressing short videos with their faces.</p>

        <p>Bukacracker is a web project totally for fun. This is a project done before I graduated from Nanjing university. At that time I can't afford an iPhone, so it is a problem that <a href="http://www.buka.cn/" target="_blank">Buka manga (布卡漫画)</a> doesn't provide a web edition or pc edition. It is really annoying. Thus, I decided to decompile their APK and figure out all the mechanisms of its communication with server side.</p>
        <p>That's how it started. And here comes the web edition of Buka manga. The work has been published to <a href="https://www.openshift.com/" target="_blank">OpenShift</a> because of its low price. Therefore, you need to break the GFW to access it.</p>
